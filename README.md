# Predictive_Maintanence_of_AirCraft_using_LSTM
# Problem Description
In this example, I build an LSTM network in order to predict remaining useful life (or time to failure) of aircraft engines , it is used to predict when an aircraft engine will fail in the future allowing maintenance to be planned in advance.
